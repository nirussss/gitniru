                    <p> It has been around 6 years since I graduated from NIU and I can see the change in me that  BSc. CSIT program has brought. Now, I am working as a Senior Software Engineer at Spotify for almost 4 years and I am proud to be a part of the NIU family as it has provided me some incredible experience.I must say that IT education at NIU is indeed the best course because after graduating from NIU, I am no less than Computer Engineers and have experienced a successful career. So, I have to give some credit to  and the faculty members at NIU for my all success.</p>
